# Connect PHP app with Cloudant Database
This pdf file shows you how you can connect your php application to the Cloudant database in IBMCloud.
Part A of the ppt talks about deploying in the local machine so for that you must have installed and configured apache webserver with php.

Part B: With slight modification we deploy the application in the cloud.

Added sample codes. Replace url with your cloudant url point in all the php files.
